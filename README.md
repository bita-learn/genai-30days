| 5 | Chat Completion API (Python) | Call OpenAI API using Python and display result |
| 6 | Role-based Prompting (system, user, assistant) | Build a mini assistant with hardcoded 3 turns |
| 7 | Assignment 1: Design a Prompt Template | Design a prompt for a ‚ÄúRecipe Generator‚Äù bot |

## üìÖ Week 2: APIs, Embeddings, RAG Basics
**Goal:** Learn how to connect LLMs with data using embeddings and vector search

| Day | Topic | Assignment/Task |
|-----|-------|------------------|
| 8 | What are Embeddings? | Use OpenAI Embedding API to vectorize sentences |
| 9 | Vector Search: FAISS/Chroma | Store and search questions from a small PDF |
| 10 | Intro to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | Build a chatbot over 1 PDF file |
| 11 | Chunking & Preprocessing Text | Write code to chunk and clean a large text file |
| 12 | Combine Vector Store + LLM = Mini ChatBot | Build a Q&A bot that responds using RAG |
| 13 | Add memory to chatbot | Use LangChain or dictionary-based memory |
| 14 | Assignment 2: Build RAG bot for your resume | Upload your resume and chat with it |

---

## üìÖ Week 3: Agents, Tools, and Workflows
**Goal:** Move from single prompts to autonomous workflows and agents

| Day | Topic | Assignment/Task |
|-----|-------|------------------|
| 15 | What is an AI Agent? Tools vs LLM | Explain differences with examples |
| 16 | LangChain Agents / Tool Calling | Create a calculator agent |
| 17 | Function Calling (OpenAI) | Let your LLM call an external API (e.g., weather API) |
| 18 | Multi-step workflows (Chain-of-Thought, ReAct) | Create a prompt that solves a multi-step math problem |
| 19 | Multi-Agent Introduction | Use CrewAI or simple logic to simulate 2 agents collaborating |
| 20 | Build a Task Manager with Agent | One agent plans tasks, other executes |
| 21 | Assignment 3: Build an agent that books a travel plan using dummy tools |

---

## üìÖ Week 4: Real-world App Building
**Goal:** Learn to build and deploy your GenAI project

| Day | Topic | Assignment/Task |
|-----|-------|------------------|
| 22 | Design Your Final Project (Ideas below) | Pick one and define scope |
| 23 | Set up environment (LangChain or barebones) | Setup Streamlit/FastAPI app structure |
| 24 | Build basic UI for your app | Use Streamlit or Gradio |
| 25 | Add GenAI feature (LLM or RAG) | Add prompt logic or document upload |
| 26 | Add memory/tool calling if needed | Use LangChain or custom logic |
| 27 | Polish and test the app | Test with dummy users |
| 28 | Deploy on Render or HuggingFace Spaces | Share public URL |

---

## üéì Days 29‚Äì30: Final Project + Presentation

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| 29 | Record a Loom demo or write a Medium post |
| 30 | Share your project on GitHub and social media, get feedback |

---

## üåü Final Project Ideas (Pick One)
- AI Study Assistant: Upload textbook PDFs and ask questions
- Recipe Agent: Takes ingredients and gives recipes + nutritional info
- Resume Analyzer: Upload CV and get job suggestions or critique
- Email Summarizer: Summarize email threads or customer support tickets
- Coding Tutor: Ask Python questions and get explanations
- Local Travel Planner: Chatbot that uses tool-calling to suggest places
